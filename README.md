Jane Go Guidelines
==================

Hello!

There are many, many, many guidelines on what "good" or "idiomatic" Go code
looks like out there.

This is Jane's!

# Who's This For?

## Jane!

The _intended_ audience of this repository is developers writing Go code at Jane. 

If you work at Jane, the documentation in this repository is definitely for
you. Here, you will find a comprehensive guideline on what your leads and fellow
developers will be looking for when they review your code. It's highly
recommended that you take a day to read through the main documentation, and
maybe peruse some examples or linked articles.

## Everybody Else?

The secondary audience is anyone who writes Go code. This set of guidelines
tries to collect best practices and community wisdom into a single living
document. There's stuff we're going to miss or ignore because it's not pertinent
to how we write code at Jane. That's okay!

We might also make decisions you heartily disagree with; maybe you don't like
how we use `context.Context`, or something else gets stuck in your craw. That's
totally fine -- so long as you don't try to make it our problem. 

This is not meant to be the best guideline on how to write perfect or
"idiomatic" Go code. Rather, this guide cribs from a lot of sources to assemble
a set of guidelines and best practices on how to write clean, clear,
maintainable Go code.

If you like the style, feel free to use it yourself! Fork the repo!

If you don't like it, that's fine. Maybe keep that to yourself though; we're
busy over here writing Go code.

# Changes

As the _intended_ audience is `developers at Jane writing Go`, that's who we'll
be listening to for feedback.

That means we'll only be accepting PRs from folks who work at Jane.

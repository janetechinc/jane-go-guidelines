* Intro
For this repo, Org has been chosen as the format of the document. Partially
because it provides more organizational features when working in large
documents, but also because it offers some ways of marking up text that are more
cumbersome in Markdown.

* Examples
** Source Blocks
Source block without a defined language:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  func goFunc(i int) int {
    return i * 2
  }
#+END_SRC

Source block /with/ a defined language:

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  func goFunc(i int) int {
    return i * 2
  }
#+END_SRC

You can also use the tilde and the equal sign for inline code:

Equals: =func DoCoolThing()=
Tilde: ~a := 2~
